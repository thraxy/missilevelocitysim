# Missile Velocity Simulator in C++

## Overview
I am using this project to get comfortable in developing in C++. I am using this to learn the syntax and become more familiar with the language. As well as getting used to pushing and pulling from github since I was not to familar with doing that.

Overall the project will be able to simulate a Missile's velocity as it travels with conditions applied to it.

## Progress
So far I have implement the formulas needed for the simulation for the missile. I also implemented a function call that allows users the input their own values for the missile.

## To-Do
I want to implement:
✔️- visualizing the simulation
- create a user interface
- give the option for the user to skip inputing their own values
- give the option for the user to import a file with values
- real-time plotting
- more options for data visualization
- documentation
- multithreading
  

## Notes
Feel free to add issues and comments if you'd like. Also any tips and advice are also welcomed. Thank you.
